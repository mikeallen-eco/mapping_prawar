# The 'Mapping Warbler Song' Project
In this project, we'll band together as a class to measure and map song characteristics of a single species, the Prairie Warbler, across the eastern US. This could reveal regional song dialects or even hidden subspecies - who knows! To do this, we'll use the hundreds of songs recordings available via the Cornell Laboratory of Ornithology Macaulay Library. Most of those songs were recorded and submitted by citizen scientists, and often as part of eBird checklists. We'll use rulers and laptops to collect several different measurements of each sonogram, pool our data, and map the results to see what the data tell us. While this analysis can't reveal WHY these patterns occur (e.g., learned dialects or local evolution), it may reveal some new questions that are worth exploring! The Prairie Warbler has only one known subspecies that occurs in south Florida. This is a continuing project and our early results from 2023 suggest some interesting geographical variation in song characteristics that don't necessarily match up with known subspecies boundaries. This year we'll increase our sample size and try to confirm this observation!

## Overview
Each group will be assigned 100 song recordings from a Prairie Warbler song database downloaded from the Macaulay Library. As a group, you will view the sonogram for each song, take 4 measurements, and record your data in your assigned spreadsheet. Then we'll combine all the class data into one database and map the results.

## Phase 1: Learn about Prairie Warbler, get your data file, and start taking measurements
0. Look up Prairie Warbler in your field guide (or online) and take a look at the species' range map and the comments about their vocalizations. Here is a quote from the "Birds of the World" account about subspecies found within the species: "Geographic variation is slight, with increasing body size and duller (grayer rather than greener) dorsal color on peninsular Florida. Mitochondrial DNA sequences show evidence of significantly restricted gene flow between subspecies but there is no evidence of substantial phylogenetic divergence (Buerkle 1997, 1999), suggesting a recent split." Two subspecies exist, including one in "coastal south Florida" (Setophaga discolor paludicola) and one inhabiting the rest of the eastern United States (Setophaga discolor discolor).
1. Get your group letter and make a word document titled "Questions - Group [group letter].docx" replacing "[group letter]" with your group letter.
2. In a web browser, go to https://www.macaulaylibrary.org/ and enter Prairie Warbler in the search box to start viewing sonograms for the species. View several examples of the species' sonograms. Look for variation among individuals. Is there a property of the song that you think would be interesting to measure? Put your answer in Question 1 of the Phase 1 questions document. Use the 'filters' in the Macaulay website to limit your selection to 1) audio by clicking the speaker button in the header, and play around with other options by clicking "More filters" and checking boxes. Download a spreadsheet (csv file) for the resulting data by clicking "export". (Note: we won't actually use this data as we already have a downloaded version for the class in the "prawar_data" folder.)
3. Close the file you exported and open the csv file corresponding with your group letter in the "prawar_data" folder. Question 2 in your word document: How many rows does it have?
3. Now it's time to start making your measurements. On your computer navigate to the "my_data" folder and open it. 
10. Time to start making measurements on your assigned sonograms. The data file you created in Step 7-8 should be in the "my_data" folder. Open it using your favorite spreadsheet software. Make the columns wider if needed. Paste the first URL in the "link" column into a web browser. It will look something like this: https://macaulaylibrary.org/asset/110249
11. Now use a ruler to make your first measurement on the first clear song in the sonogram associated with that link. See the image in the "prawar_data" folder for an illustration of what the measurements mean. Briefly, they are:
num_sylables = the number of syllables ('notes') in the song.
freq_range_mm = the range of frequencies in mm (measured with ruler)
duration_mm = the length of the song in mm (measured with ruler)
two_khz_mm = the length of 2 kHz on the scale bar in mm (measured with ruler)
two_sec_mm = the length of 2 seconds on the scale bar in mm (with ruler)
Hint: measure the height of 1 kHz or 1 second to help you take accurate measurements. If the sonogram is not clear, there is no song, or if it seems to be the wrong species (Field Sparrows are occasionally mislabeled as Prairie Warblers), then enter NA in the measurement fields and enter a note into the "skip_notes" field.
12. Repeat this process for each link in the data file. Be sure to save your data file. You can stop partway and finish later. If you are on a virtual lab machine, be sure to email yourself the data or otherwise save it safely. You can also take the whole code repository with you by "zipping" the whole "mapping_warblers" folder you are working in and emailing it to yourself.
13. Once you are done collecting all your measurements, send the completed data file to michael ( d o. t ) allen (at) rutgers ( dot ) edu.

## Phase 3: make maps and plots summarizing our collective results
14. Download the compiled course data csv file and add it to your "my_data" folder.
15. Open the RStudio project again. Next, open the "mapping_prawar2.Rmd" file and follow the instructions to create maps and graphs summarizing the class measurements. Plots will be saved to your "my_output" folder.
16. Write a mini scientific paper with the following sections (~1 paragraph each, can be short paragraphs!): introduction, methods, results, discussion, literature cited (at least 2 primary references). Include the three maps we created as figures 1-3 with proper captions. Split up the writing among group members. Note: these "papers" can be relatively rough as we are writing them primarily in class. Turn it in via email with all group member names on it.
