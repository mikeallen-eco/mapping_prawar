","Male singing above car first thing shortly after dawn broke. Stood near him for some time, watching as he sang and occasionally moved from one perch to another, noting that he seemed to favour one above small open space adjacent to roadside, his attention drawn downward here. Eventually there was movement below, and I looked down to see female on low bough of white pine for a moment before disappearing. Male moved off as well at this time, his songs becoming quiet and infrequent. I wandered down and stood at spot where female appeared, lowering myself and searching edge of bushes at roadside where she must have flown from. To my surprise there was a fresh structure, relatively visible from this angle, tucked in main fork of small deciduous shrub right next to road where it was completely concealed from sight but car tires surely pass within two meters of it. I walked up to it, puzzled, to find it completely empty. I left for a little while, and returned to have a closer look at structure again. To my surprise (somehow) she flushed off of nest at two meters and flew to sit in the open on the same pine bough as earlier, chip quietly, and fly away. Apparently incubation of empty nests has been documented in several non-passerine and passerine species such as Great Tit, Common Blackbird, and Pied Flycatcher - perhaps this is another case of this.   Also spent several hours off at the west side of the clearing with the neighbouring pair. As I walked down the road over to the other side, the male was singing quietly high above me on one of the tower beams. Raising binoculars, I noticed a fat green bug in his bill. His song wasn't just quiet, it was muffled. A few moments later he dropped and flew far, vanishing well beyond peak of hill. I wandered up and around to the other side where I relocated him, foraging and singing occasionally at the peaks of pines at edge of clearing. After an hour or so watching them I found the nest tucked in tiny fork one meter high in the middle of a very bouncy juniper branch, containing two chicks, as well as two unhatched eggs.",Setophaga discolor,prawar,Species,32879,,3.00,1,"",,

The recording was made by taking video with my smartphone in the direction of the singing. I extracted the audio and boosted the volume using Pazera Free Audio Extractor. In the program Audacity, I trimmed the audio to remove the sounds from my starting and ending the recording. Then I used the Amplify effect to reduce the volume of a couple of loud pops in the middle of the recording when I moved closer to the bird.","Lifer!! I entered Pine Tree Trail from the west side (lakeside) trailhead. Only a few steps in, I realized I was hearing a vaguely familiar bird song (something I've studied, but haven't experienced in person). So I followed the sound and quickly came to a small sandy clearing. I soon found an overall bright yellow warbler with cheeks outlined in bold black, similarly bold black streaks on its sides that faded down the flanks, dark wings, and an olive crown and nape. I quickly recognized it as an adult male Prairie Warbler! I couldn't see any red on his back, but I read that this is not unusual. I noted that he was pumping his tail. He was singing up a storm! He even sang two versions of the same song: both were rising in pitch, but one was slow and measured, the other was fast and accelerated.

About 10:00 a.m. I was surprised to hear the distinctive song of a Prairie Warbler and alerted Drew and Susan. Soon we were able to see it as it continued singing several songs per minute until 10:35 a.m. (some 75-100 songs total). We were joined at 10:20 by Tom and Alex Lewanski; both heard it well and Alex got good views also. We are confident that this bird did not sing from this location prior to 10:00 since from our separate monitoring positions we were very unlikely to have overlooked it. At 10:35 it quit singing and flew to the north. Tom and Alex spent the rest of the morning searching in the direction it flew but were unable to relocate it. I made subsequent trips to that area on 9 June (6:45-10:05 a.m.) and 19 June (6:35-09:20 a.m.) and did not record it. We presume this was a wandering vagrant male attempting to solicit a mate by singing in a temporary territory, then moving on. We verbally described field marks while we watched it; when I returned home I wrote the description on my computer before I consulted references. I recorded six songs, three consecutive ones and then 20 min. later, three more (Marantz PMD-660 digital recorder, Sennheiser ME-67 directional microphone). The songs were very distinctive: a series of about 15 evenly spaced sharp buzzy notes, the first few on the same pitch, then remainder rising steadily in pitch, zee-zee-zee-zee- . . . -zee-zee-zee, with a buzzy but piercing quality similar to “zee” notes of Black-throated Green Warbler “zee-zee-zee-zoo-zee” song. Drew, Susan, and I had good views from as close as about 20m. It was a small warbler appearing a bit smaller and more slender than Yellow Warbler (but none present for direct comparison); yellow below, pale undertail coverts, dark streaks on sides, olive above. Face pattern unique: black arc below eye from bill gape to cheek; yellow above that but below eye; black through eye; yellow supercilium; crown olive. Back did not have bold rufous streaks but we saw a hint of rufous, possibly suggesting 2nd-year male. Wing bars weak but present. We did not observe tail bobbing, or white in tail. [Dunn and Garrett note that males do not normally bob their tails when singing from a song perch.] Sang from scrubby oak saplings mostly but also in more mature oaks. The habitat (scattered oak saplings, sumac stands) looked quite suitable for this species. Below is the first recording of three consecutive songs (starting at 10:02 a.m.), unedited except for high pass filter (1500 Hz) to reduce low-frequency background noise. This was typical of the spacing of songs over the 35 min. we heard and watched it.",Setophaga discolor,prawar,Species,32879,,3.00,2,"",,

Was not observed when I arrived, but I refound it later after hiking down to the other tower and back. It was actively singing and flycatching, then flew off north of the parking lot. Just before leaving, I found it sitting very low on a branch, hunkered-down from the wind only a couple feet in front of me as I looked off in the distance trying to look for it in the grasses. This gave excellent views, as it remained perched for a long time, often looking rather sleepy. After about 30 minutes it got back up for more flycatching.  Audio recorded, video taken, photos taken.",Setophaga discolor,prawar,Species,32879,,4.00,2,"",,
