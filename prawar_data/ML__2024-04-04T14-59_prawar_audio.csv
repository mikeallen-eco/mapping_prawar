Backlit, the warbler was dimly patterned, but clearly the source of the song. I moved into a better position, almost directly below the warbler and looked straight up to see all the field markings come into focus: solid yellow from throat to base of long all-white tail, dark neck spots and black tiger stripes on sides, dark semi-circle under eye. Recorded audio and sent alert.

There is also some noise, unfortunately, from the usual trifecta of dissonance: wind, walking, and handling.  I captured this audio in .mp4 format by taking a video with my Samsung S5. Using the program Ocenaudio, I extracted the audio in .wav format and created a copy of the sound file. Then I applied minimal edits: only trimming the recording and normalizing the volume to -3 dB.","Lifer!! I entered Pine Tree Trail from the west side (lakeside) trailhead. Only a few steps in, I realized I was hearing a vaguely familiar bird song (something I've studied, but haven't experienced in person). So I followed the sound and quickly came to a small sandy clearing. I soon found an overall bright yellow warbler with cheeks outlined in bold black, similarly bold black streaks on its sides that faded down the flanks, dark wings, and an olive crown and nape.

About 10:00 a.m. I was surprised to hear the distinctive song of a Prairie Warbler and alerted Drew and Susan. Soon we were able to see it as it continued singing several songs per minute until 10:35 a.m. (some 75-100 songs total). We were joined at 10:20 by Tom and Alex Lewanski; both heard it well and Alex got good views also. We are confident that this bird did not sing from this location prior to 10:00 since from our separate monitoring positions we were very unlikely to have overlooked it. At 10:35 it quit singing and flew to the north. Tom and Alex spent the rest of the morning searching in the direction it flew but were unable to relocate it. I made subsequent trips to that area on 9 June (6:45-10:05 a.m.) and 19 June (6:35-09:20 a.m.) and did not record it. We presume this was a wandering vagrant male attempting to solicit a mate by singing in a temporary territory, then moving on. We verbally described field marks while we watched it; when I returned home I wrote the description on my computer before I consulted references. I recorded six songs, three consecutive ones and then 20 min. later, three more (Marantz PMD-660 digital recorder, Sennheiser ME-67 directional microphone). The songs were very distinctive: a series of about 15 evenly spaced sharp buzzy notes, the first few on the same pitch, then remainder rising steadily in pitch, zee-zee-zee-zee- . . . -zee-zee-zee, with a buzzy but piercing quality similar to “zee” notes of Black-throated Green Warbler “zee-zee-zee-zoo-zee” song. Drew, Susan, and I had good views from as close as about 20m. It was a small warbler appearing a bit smaller and more slender than Yellow Warbler (but none present for direct comparison); yellow below, pale undertail coverts, dark streaks on sides, olive above. Face pattern unique: black arc below eye from bill gape to cheek; yellow above that but below eye; black through eye; yellow supercilium; crown olive. Back did not have bold rufous streaks but we saw a hint of rufous, possibly suggesting 2nd-year male. Wing bars weak but present. We did not observe tail bobbing, or white in tail. [Dunn and Garrett note that males do not normally bob their tails when singing from a song perch.] Sang from scrubby oak saplings mostly but also in more mature oaks. The habitat (scattered oak saplings, sumac stands) looked quite suitable for this species. Below is the first recording of three consecutive songs (starting at 10:02 a.m.), unedited except for high pass filter (1500 Hz) to reduce low-frequency background noise. This was typical of the spacing of songs over the 35 min. we heard and watched it.",Setophaga discolor,prawar,Species,33643,,3.00,2,"",,

I was checking a bee research block when I heard what I thought was a some type of warbler. Upon further investigation, I spotted a warbler with a bright yellow throat, breast, and belly. I then heard the song and was able to resolve that it was a prairie warbler. There was a PRAW found hear last june so this is not unheard of at this location. My original intent for this visit was not necessarily birding but I first heard what appeared to be a Prairie Warbler. I continued on to do the task that I had originally came to do. After I was done, I got my recording equipment out in the case that I heard this again. I walked to the location that I had originally heard it and waited for about an hour. I walked around for another hour and a half and finally heard the tell tale pitch of this warbler. I managed to attain a recording of it and afforded a few good looks. For those that may go to look for this, please respect this fragile ecosystem. Please do not cause any erosion on the slopes. Respect the land being that it is a Scientific and Natural Area.
